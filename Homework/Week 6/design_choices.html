            <h2>Update/merge</h2> 
            <p>
              I want the visualizations vertically positioned from eachother, because the map needs a lot of width and so does the scatter plot to display all data.
              I have taken a look at the update and merge method, but the merge function is only available in version 4 of d3 and my whole program is based on a previous version.
              Besides this, the merge option only seems relevant when you actually 'update' data instead of completely showing different data. Since every scatter is completely different, it doesn't seem like it would be necessary to go out of the way in implementing this (even though the current method is a bit hacker-ish). And since everything needs to be renewed (scales, axes, data points), no extra work is done by redoing it all.

            <h2>Map color</h2> 
            <p>            
              I have chosen to go with a color scale from light yellow to dark red, 
              because I feel like this scale is most distinguishable from one category to the other
              given the amount of categories there are. </br>
              I've only chosen to highlight the country itself and not the border too for a less cluttery appearance.
              Highlight color type of blue, because it is complementary with orange, the color inbetween light yellow and (dark) red.
              The intuitive color scale makes a visual query in determining which countries in the world are poorer (as seen per inhabitant) 
              in contrast to the rest of the world easy, but it is not possible to see if the cause is because of a large population number, or
              a general low income. That is not part of the data. </br>
              The color scale has pre-defined categories. This is because the legend is automatically created using these categories.
              Normally I would have used the ordinal color scale that is part of d3.

            <h2>Map tooltip and legend</h2> 
            <p>
              Additionally a tooltip shows the country name and its nominal gdp per capita. I've let out the 'category' dimension in the tooltip,
              because it is deducable from the gdp and the legend. </br>
              Unfortunately the legend itself is really hard to customize, as no real documentation or examples are provided to do so.
              I don't see any way (given the examples) to refer to this element. Furthermore it is too complicated to make a similar legend from scratch for now.

            <h2>Scatter plot</h2> 
            <p>
              The design of the scatter plot is meant to be minimalistic: high data/ink ratio. No unnecessary colors.
              A clear interaction when hovering a data point,
              and a useful tooltip. Buttons on the side can be pressed to go back to the default world scatter plot, show data info, and change 
              the size of the data points.
