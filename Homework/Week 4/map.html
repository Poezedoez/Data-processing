Design choices:

I have chosen to go with a color scale from light yellow to dark red, 
because I feel like this scale is most distinguishable from one category to the other
given the amount of categories there are.
I've only chosen to highlight the country itself and not the border too for a less cluttery appearance.
Highlight color type of blue, because it is complementary with orange, the color inbetween light yellow and (dark) red.
Additionally a tooltip shows the country name and its nominal gdp per capita. I've let out the 'category' dimension in the tooltip,
because it is deducable from the gdp and the legend.
Unfortunately the legend itself is really hard to customize, as no real documentation or examples are provided to do so.
The intuitive color scale makes a visual query in determining which countries in the world are poorer (as seen per inhabitant) 
in contrast to the rest of the world easy, but it is not possible to see if the cause is because of a large population number, or
a general low income. That is not part of the data.
